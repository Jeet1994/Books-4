=head0 Web Frameworks

Web development in Perl started with the X<CGI> X<Module, CGI> C<CGI>
module. It includes mechanisms to generate HTML from Perl statements,
and to access CGI parameters, sessions and cookies. Although it is a
quite powerful method it shows the sign of age, and there are a wide
variety of other tools that make Web development easier, more
structured and faster. These are the main reasons why the C<CGI>
module will not be focused in this chapter. Yet another reason is the
quantity of books and tutorials that are available that teach how to
develop with C<CGI>.

There are a lot of Web Frameworks in Perl, and with the advent of
C<PSGI> and C<Plack> X<PSGI> X<Module, PSGI> X<Plack> X<Module, Plack>
the interface between web servers and Perl got more user friendly,
that lead to even more frameworks.

This book does not intent to be a full reference to CPAN modules, or
to be a in-depth book on too technical aspects. These reasons made us
decide to not exploit C<PSGI> or C<Plack> directly, but present some
of the frameworks that use them, like C<Dancer> or C<Mojolicious>.

This section will B<introduce> Web programming using four different
web frameworks:

=item B<Catalyst>

The X<Module, Catalyst> X<Catalyst> C<Catalyst> web framework is
probably the most well known nowadays. It is a complete and efficient
web framework. Its main drawback if the complexity of projects for new
developers. There are some book about it, which explain why our
section on it is quite reduced.

=item B<Mason>

The success of PHP lead to some similar approaches for other
languages. There are different tries to get a module with a similar
philosophy, but C<Mason> X<Module, Mason> X<Mason> is probably the
only one that was widely used. Not because of following a PHP-like
approach, but for taking it a step forward.

=item B<Mojoliciou>

C<Mojolicious> was developed after C<Catalyst>, by the same main
author. The idea was to simplify it, making it easier to use and
lighter. 

=item B<Dancer>

Heavily inspired by Ruby Sinatra, C<Dancer> is gaining adepts in the
last monthes. The fact of one of the book authors is a C<Dancer>
developer was a reason good enough to include it here.
