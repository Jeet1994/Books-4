=head0 The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network

The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, known as CPAN is an archive of
Perl applications, modules and frameworks. It is named after another
archive, The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network, an archive of TeX and
LaTeX modules and styles.

CPAN is an Archive of Perl stuff, it is available throught the Network
and is Comprehensive, in the sense that it is a large collection, but
also that it includes nearly all developed modules, and they are
available in an organized way.

Note that CPAN does not have any kind of guarantee that the available
modules are not malicious, or that provides the documented
features. Therefore, knowing what modules are being used by the
community is great, as it gives information about their quality and
trust.

CPAN is available from L<http://cpan.org/> or one of the hundreds of
available mirror. You can access the modules using C<FTP> or, more
interesting, using the search feature of CPAN. It will give you
information on the module author, what the latest version is, points
to the download file, gives you access to the module documentation and
a rating system, where users can rate modules.

There are a bunch of other web sites that were developed to make the
CPAN experience more rich. There are some of them:

=item B<AnnoCPAN>

AnnoCPAN (L<http://www.annocpan.org>) gives you access to modules
documentation, but also to annotations over that documentation. What
this means, is that any user can annotate the documentation with
further information, incoherences and other (relevant) information.

=item B<CPANForum>

CPANForum (L<http://cpanforum.com/>) offers a forum for each
module. Some authors maintain their forum active, some others do not
use them. Some others, prefer to create forums in other web sites, or
to create mailing lists.

=item B<CPANTesters>

CPANTesters (L<http://static.cpantesters.org/>) gives information
about how each module installs, and how their tests pass or fail in
different architectures. When installing a module, if the build fails,
this web site can be used to detect whether it is a local fail, or a
known bug. For module developers it is useful to check if modules are
portable and if tests pass.
