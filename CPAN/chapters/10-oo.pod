X<Moo>X<Module, Moo> X<Moose>X<Module, Moose> X<Mouse>X<Module, Mouse>
X<OO Programming> Perl always suffered from the lack of a rigid object
oriented system. Although blessed references did the trick for years,
developers felt sorry they did not have support for some common OO
features, like interfaces (or roles), multiple inheritance and
encapsulation.

A few years ago C<Moose> appeared. At first it was quite slow and its
usage was discouraged. Fortunately, in the last years, C<Moose> became
quite fast and includes a lot of relevant and useful features.

Nevertheless, C<Moose> is still quite slow for applications that need
to start every time. That is, in applications like CGI scripts, that
are parsed and run every time a request is made, the overhead of
loading C<Moose> is not acceptable.

To solve this problem some developers started C<Mouse>, a smaller
implementation that does not include all C<Moose> functionalities, but
only the more relevant ones. It maintains the API compatible with
C<Moose>, making it easier to switch whenever needed.

Another implementation, named C<Moo>, claims to be yet smaller and
faster than C<Mouse>, although it does not have much users yet.

Given all these modules share the basic syntax, this chapter structure
will be slightly different from the next ones. First, we will present
C<Moo>, then, what C<Mouse> offers over C<Moo>, and finally, what
C<Moose> offers more than C<Mouse>. This approach will make this
chapter smaller and help the reader when choosing one implementation.

C<Moo> uses the usual approach to define objects: use packages (the
Perl equivalent to what we are used to call classes). Follows a simple
example of a I<Person> object with two attributes, I<name> and
I<phone>. The first is a read only attribute (you can't change the
person name after initializing the object) while the second has
read/write permissions. This information is used by C<Moo> to define
whether to create accessors that are able to set and get values, or
just get values. The I<required> option means that every time a
I<Person> object is created a name must be supplied.

=begin Perl

 package Person;
 use Moo;

 has name  => ( is => 'ro',  required => 1 );

 has phone => ( is => 'rw' );

 1;

=end Perl

Note that the fat arrow is equivalent to a comma, and the parenthesis
are not needed. The first attribute could be defined as:

  has "name", "is", "ro", "required", 1;

but its legibility is not the same. Therefore we will stick to the
usage of the fat arrow together with parenthesis to group attribute
options.

This object usage is similar to the usage of standard blessed
objects. C<Moo> creates automatically the constructor and accessors.

=begin Perl

 use Person;
 my $person = Person->new(name => 'John');

 print $person->name;

 $person->phone("93453423");
 print $person->phone;

=end Perl

Unlike the next two alternatives, C<Moo> doesn't have a type
system. If you need to guarantee that an attribute keeps a specific
type of data, you need to validate it yourself. That is done adding a
code reference. The next example is a redefinition of the attribute
C<phone> forcing a nine digits string:

=begin Perl

 has phone => (
      is  => 'rw',
      isa => sub {
         die "Need a nine digit string!" unless $_[0] =~ /^\d{9}$/
      };

=end Perl
