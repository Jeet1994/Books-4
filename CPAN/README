Book Guides
--------------------------------

1. Chapters should be independents

A reader can read just a chapter, and no dependencies to other chapter
should exist. Only pointers for further information.

2. Sections should be independents

Only the first paragraphs of the chapter, before the first section,
should/can compare the modules being discussed. Each module section
should not compare to other modules unless it is strictly necessary.

3. See also section

Each chapter should end in a special section named 'See also', that is
an itemize of modules available on CPAN for similar tasks, and small
description on them.

4. Depth

No section should have more than 15 pages. I can accept a limit of 20
for big frameworks like Catalyst. If it is impossible to explain the
module in such a reduced number of pages, then the module should not
be included (put it into the see also section, and point to other
books/documentation).
